# Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning  

This project applies **unsupervised learning techniques** to perform customer segmentation. By analyzing purchasing patterns and demographic data, it identifies distinct customer groups, allowing businesses to understand their clients better and design targeted marketing campaigns, improve customer experience, and enhance profitability.  

---

## Key Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans data, handles missing values, and scales features for clustering.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examines distributions, correlations, and customer behavior patterns.  
- **Clustering Techniques**: Implements **K-Means**, **Hierarchical Clustering**, and **DBSCAN** to group customers.  
- **Optimal Cluster Selection**: Uses the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to determine the best number of clusters.  
- **Visualization**: Provides 2D/3D visualizations of clusters for interpretation.  
- **Business Insights**: Helps in identifying high-value, price-sensitive, and loyal customer groups.

## Why This Project?  
Not all customers behave the same way. By segmenting customers, businesses can:  
- Personalize marketing campaigns.  
- Improve customer retention.  
- Design loyalty programs.  
- Allocate resources effectively.  

This approach turns raw customer data into **actionable insights**.

## Usage  
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-Hurraira/customer-segmentation.git
   cd customer-segmentation
   ```
2. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Future Work  
- Test advanced clustering methods such as **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**.  
- Apply **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction.  
- Deploy segmentation as an API for real-time predictions.  
- Integrate with business dashboards (Tableau, Power BI, or Streamlit).
